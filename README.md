Subset are constructed from a set with more than 12.000 ray-X medical images from breast region to can processed in low-performance computer. The EHD, SIFT, LBP, Gabor and Zernike techniques are used to feature the samples from formed set. The created sets are used to train and test the created model by multi-label classifiers. Finally, are evaluated the performance from selected algorithms to the task of classify images with multiples labels.
